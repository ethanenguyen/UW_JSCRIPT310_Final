This is a simple Black Jack game to demonstrate the ability of ChatGPT to undestand the rules of Black Jack and basic probability 

The game can be played manually with "Hit" and "Stand" 

To communicate to ChatGPT a UAT is needed.  If UAT is not provided, the code can connect to a "fake" ChatGPT endpoint which will randomly generate "Hit" or "Stand"

When there is no cards left to draw, the screen will slowly turn to dark
